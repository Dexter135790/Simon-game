# Simon Game ðŸŽ®

This is a simple implementation of the classic Simon Game, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## About

The Simon Game is a memory-based game where the player has to repeat the randomly generated sequence of colors. Each level gets progressively harder as the sequence grows longer.

The game includes:

* Four colored buttons: red, blue, green, and yellow.
* Sound effects for each button.
* Level progression with game-over logic.

## Technologies Used

* HTML: For the structure of the web page.
* CSS: For styling the buttons and page.
* JavaScript: For game logic and interactivity.

## How to Play

* Open the game in your browser.
* Press any key to start the game.
* Watch the sequence of colors carefully.
* Click the buttons in the same order as the displayed sequence.
* Each correct sequence progresses you to the next level.
* A wrong click will end the game.
